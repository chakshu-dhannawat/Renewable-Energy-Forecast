# Renewale-Energy-Forecast

In this repository I have experimented with the [Temporal Fusion Transformer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021000637), TFT's in short, algorithm for forecasting future demand/production of renewable energy.

Since TFT's have proven to give results which are explainanble due to the forecasting of multiple variables together and giving implicit attention, thus, they would be the perfect algorithm to experiment on Renewable energy. As, renewable energy generation is dependent on many external factors, and is very volatile with many fluctuations, TFT's could predict the futute external variations and explain the volatility in Renewable enrgy gerenration.<br>

Here is a link to understand TFT's better: [Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/temporal-fusion-transformer-a-primer-on-deep-forecasting-in-python-4eb37f3f3594#:~:text=1.1%20What%20Is%20A%20Temporal,attention%20heads%20used%20in%20Transformers.)
